Tucan: Mexican Made Crafts,<br/>
Tucan is basically a one stop store for any quality souvenir you could want to find. This is not the 
typical shot glass and tee shirt place; this is hand crafted unique items. There was a large 
selection of pottery, silver jewelry, dolls, housewares, spices, condiments, Christmas ornamnets, 
linens etc.
